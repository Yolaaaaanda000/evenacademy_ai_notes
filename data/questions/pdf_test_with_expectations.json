    "解题思路": "To ensure each teacher is between two students, no teacher can be on the ends and no two teachers can be adjacent. First, imagine placing the 7 students, which creates 6 empty spaces between them (S _ S _ S _ S _ S _ S _ S). We need to place the 3 distinct teachers in these 6 available spots. The number of ways to do this is a permutation: P(6,3) = 6 * 5 * 4 = 120.",

    "题目": "A gardener plants three identical maple trees, four identical oak trees, and five identical birch trees in a row. How many ways are there such that no two birch trees are next to one another?",

    "解题思路": "First, place the non-birch trees: 3 identical maples (M) and 4 identical oaks (O). The number of ways to arrange them is C(7,3) = 35. These 7 trees create 8 possible slots where the birch trees (B) can be planted (_T_T_T_T_T_T_T_). We need to place 5 identical birch trees in these 8 slots, with at most one per slot. The number of ways to choose these slots is C(8,5) = 56. Total ways = (ways to arrange M and O) * (ways to place B) = 35 * 56 = 1960. There appears to be a discrepancy between the calculated answer and the options. However, this type of problem sometimes has errors in the provided options. If we must choose, let's re-evaluate. The calculation and method are standard and correct. There may be an error in the problem's source. Assuming option B=840 is correct implies a different setup, but based on the text, 1960 is the answer.",
